Welcome to our 3rd exercise!
Today, you will be required to use the dependency injection concept in order to be able to write testable code.


Definition
==========


We are going to develop a very basic and simplistic version of a micro payment service provider gateway, PSP Gateway.
For educative purposes we will keep this simple, although there are more standard ways of transferring parameters.
Our engine should accept HTTP Requests with the next POST parameters:

* Application ID ( 32 characters )
 Our system will accept payments from different apps, so we need to keep track of this.

* Order ID ( 32 characters )
 App order ID , to be able to trace the payment back.

* CC type ( 16 characters )
 One of ( VISA | MASTERCARD | AMEX )

* CC Beholder ( 64 characters )

* CC Number ( 16 digits )

* CC Expiry Month ( 2 digits )

* CC Expiry Year ( 2 digits )

* CC CVV ( 7 digits )

* Charge Amount ( 12 digits , dot separated decimals )

* Charge Currency ( 3 digits )
 Optional parameter, ISO 4217 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217 , Default EUR

* Transaction request security key  ( 32 characters )
 The requests include a code to ensure they are real transaction requests.

The Payment Security Engine ( PSE ) is different depending on the Application ID . Older applications use a less secure engine, v1,
newer apps use one of the newer algorithms, v2 or v3 .

PSE v1:
The security key is just the first character of the next values concatenated in the this order:
 Application ID + Order ID + CC Type + CC Beholder + CC Number + CC Expiry Month + CC Expiry year + CC CVV
 + Charge Amount + Day of the Month using 2 characters


PSE v2:
The security key is a one way authentication algorithm ( md5 ) , using the next values concatenated in this order:
 Application ID + Order ID + CC Type + CC Beholder + CC Number + CC Expiry Month + CC Expiry year + CC CVV
 + Charge Amount + Current Month Day using 2 characters


PSE V3:
The security key is a hybrid encryption algorithm ( GPG , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard ) . However,
this version has still not been released . It is optional for those who finish quickly the exercise, to implement
this PSE version.
